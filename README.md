# Play 2.2 

Play 2.2 is a high productivity Java and Scala Web application framework, integrating all components and API needed for modern Web application development. 

It is based on a lightweight stateless Web friendly architecture and features predictable and minimal resources consumption (CPU, Memory, Threads) for highly scalable applications thanks to its reactive model based on Iteratee IO.

We use [Travis CI](http://travis-ci.org/) to test and verify the build: [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/bblfish/Play20.png)](http://travis-ci.org/bblfish/Play20)

## TLS differences

This branch differs from the main play branch in that it supports TLS client authentication as well 
as server authentivation. The `RequestHeader` trait has a cert method that allows you to request a client
certificate asynchronously - the client will be asked for his certificate if he has one.

```scala
   def certs(required:Boolean): Future[Seq[Certificate]]
```

Certificates that are signed by CAs in the trust store can be requested, or by
specifying the empty trust store any client certificate will be requested. This
is useful for implementing protocols such as [WebID](http://webid.info/), as is done
by [RWW-Play](http://github.com/read-write-web/rww-play)

```scala
  run  -Dhttps.port=8443 -Dhttps.trustStore=noCA 
```

This API is still prone to change, see:
* [ticket 828: client certificate support](https://play.lighthouseapp.com/projects/82401-play-20/tickets/828-client-certificate-support)
* [ticket 787: passing certificate-validation-level info to the client](https://play.lighthouseapp.com/projects/82401/tickets/787)

## Installing

For your convenience the most recent builds that pass the test suites [are uploaded here](http://mail.spiroid.org/play/releases/).

You first need to build Play:

```bash
$ cd framework/
$ ./build
> publish-local
```

Then, for convenience, add the framework installation directory to your system PATH.  
On UNIX systems, it would be something like:

```bash
export PATH=$PATH:/path/to/play2.2
```

On windows systems you'll need to set it in the global environment variables.

> If youâ€™re on UNIX, make sure that the play script is executable (otherwise do a chmod a+x play).

## Getting started

Enter any existing Play 2.2 application directory and use the `play` command to launch the development console:

```bash
$ cd ~/workspace/myApplication
$ play
```

You can also directly use `play run` to run the application:

```bash
$ cd ~/workspace/myApplication
$ play run
```

Use `play new yourNewApplication` to create a new application:

```bash
$ cd ~/workspace
$ play new myNewApplication
```

Once the application is created, use it as any existing application:

```bash
$ cd myNewApplication
$ play
```

## Running the sample applications

There are several samples applications included in the `samples/` directory. For example, to run the included Scala Hello World application:

```bash
$ cd ~/workspace/play2.1/samples/scala/helloworld/
$ play run
```
> The application will be available on port 9000.
